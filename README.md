# Neural machine translation

Minimalist implementation of supervised neural machine translation on Multi30K dataset with seq2seq architecture, attention meachanism and beam search in PyTorch. For data loading I utilise the [TorchText](https://github.com/pytorch/text) library. The code is a simplified version of the seq2seq model from ParlAI.
