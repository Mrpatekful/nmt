# Neural machine translation

Minimalist implementation of supervised neural machine translation on Multi30K dataset with seq2seq architecture, attention meachanism and beam search in PyTorch. Torchtext library is used as data loader, however I rely on tweaks, which are only implemented in my forked [version](https://github.com/Mrpatekful/text).
